# Front-End Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of front-end web development projects I built while following a YouTube tutorial playlist. Each project helped me practice and strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While many core ideas come from the tutorials, I’ve also added my own features, explored additional use cases, and documented important properties, methods, and concepts used in each project.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project is stored in its own folder and contains:

- `projectname.html` – The main HTML file
- `projectname.css` – Stylesheet for visual design
- `projectname.js` – JavaScript logic
- `documentation.docx` – Personal research with detailed explanations of the concepts used
