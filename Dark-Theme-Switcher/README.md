🛠 Features Implemented
  - A toggle switch that alternates between light and dark themes.
  - Theme preference is **persisted using `localStorage`**, so the user's choice is retained after reloads.


While I didn’t add new functionality in this one , I thoroughly researched and documented every property, method, and attribute used in the code 🧠.

2. CSS variables are updated to change colors across the page.
3. User preference is saved via `localStorage` and applied on future visits.
